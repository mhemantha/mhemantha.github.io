I had seen this on quite a few recent best book lists but somehow completely
missed its YA billing (probably because of how I try to limit my curiosity when
scouting for the next book so I can dive into it with as open a mind as
possible at this age). Considering how I lap up holocaust stories, I was
confident enough it wouldn't disappoint.

The prose seemed unusual and at first blush, even interesting. But within first
few pages, I was so stuck with its infelicity, I had to flip back and check if
it was a half-hearted translation. Every couple of pages, there was another
misused idiom or an erratic adjective or an unfathomable metaphor or even
outright spurious words to break the flow of reading
[<sup>*</sup>](#tbt-note1). Disconcertingly, this jagged style seemed
intentional (perhaps a misplaced, even patronizing, attempt; a dumbing down of
language?). There's an overall impression of words and ideas thrown together
haphazardly making it a chore to plow through the artificial denseness. The
sketches add absolutely nothing. The 3-page or so handwritten booklet is the
height of pretentiousness beside being PITA to read in an ereader.

Looking past the style, story itself doesn't have much to commend. Each story
element seems to have been mawkishly chosen and overwrought to wring as much
mushiness as possible. There are touching moments given it's holocaust
background but by the first half, the feeling of commercial sentimentality
pervades every scene.
